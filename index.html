      <h1>Summary</h1>
       <p>I created a visual prototype for a new kind of wellness app. One that makes the process and documentation so easy, it feels impossible to break the chain of consistency. This app is for those struggling to find their flow in the gym lifestyle.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>The problem that I aimed to save was how workout apps can be overwhelping to new gym goers, so the main mission is developing an easy and aesthetically pleasing process.</p></div>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>My app tackles this issue head on with a streamlined, fool-proof process designed to get the user gently hooked to the fitness lifestyle.</p>

      <h1>Low Fidelity Wireframes and User Flow</h1>
        <p>I decided to go with a guided tour to show the user where each button is for the main actions. I kept it at three steps because there are very few buttons in the interface.</p>

        <h1>Visual Design</h1>
        <p>Throughout my design, I use orange and purple to provide contrast and balance. I also use cirlces in various pages to connect to the main function, tapping the circle to fill the chain. The fonts I used are Trirong for the headings and Rubik for the body copy.</p>

      <h1>Relection</h1>
      <p>I really enjoyed the challenge that this project presented to us with thinking deeply about user experience design, how to design for a client, and the deep dive into Adobe Xd. While I found this interesting, there were definitley some parts that tripped me up and some that I feel I did well at.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <li>Difficulty with animating some parts</li>
      <li>Hard to manage vertical space on a screen</li>
      <li>Apple IOS elements are difficult to design for at times</li>
      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <li>Visual branding</li>
      <li>User Experience</li>
